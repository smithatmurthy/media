Exynos4x12 SoC series Imaging Subsystem (FIMC-IS)

The FIMC-IS is an subsystem for processing image signal from an image sensor.
The Exynos4x12 SoC series FIMC-IS V1.5 comprises of a dedicated ARM Cortex-A5
processor, ISP, DRC and FD IP blocks and peripheral IPs such as I2C, SPI, UART
bus controllers, Multi-PWM and ADC.

fimc-is node
------------

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "samsung,exynos4212-fimc-is" for Exynos4212 and
	       Exynos4412 SoCs;
- reg	     : physical base address and size of the device memory mapped
	       registers;
- interrupts : should contain FIMC-IS interrupts;

The following are the FIMC-IS peripheral device nodes and can be specified
either standalone or as fimc-is child nodes.

pmu subnode
-----------

Required properties:
 - reg	: should contain PMU physical base address of the memory mapped
          registers and size, the value of size should be 0x3000.


i2c-isp (ISP I2C bus controller) nodes
------------------------------------------

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "samsung,exynos4212-i2c-isp" for Exynos4212 and
	       Exynos4412 SoCs;
- reg	     : physical base address and size of the device memory mapped
	       registers;

For the above nodes it is required to specify a pinctrl state named "default",
according to the pinctrl bindings defined in ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.
